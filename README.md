# About This Project

A **Single Page Application** Introducing My favorite musics.
I really love musics and also love to make my own favorite music DB.
I think it will be great to introduce my favorite musics to my friends in the world and share my fantastic experience with the musics.
It doesn't have a living backend for serving my favorite music data.
But in the future, I will make a server for this.
Of course, my music DB will be updated whenever I find new great music.
